# The Surfing Project
my very 1st project after just 3days of training! :)
  
### The aim of this project was to practice HTML and Bootstrap for quick creation of a responsive landing page, and learn how to make repos/commits/pushes on Github.

### Day3 - The Surfing Project:

This project will make you practice Bootstrap, discover the power of responsive, and prepare you for tomorrow and the notions of Landing Pages and Bootstrap themes.

The page must be created using Bootstrap as much as possible, with a minimal amount of CSS.
It will have to be responsive (adapting to the user's screen size).

Here is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GjTtsBA.jpg">the mobile version</a> of the page to code (#mobile_first). And here, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zZzjc3t.jpg">the Desktop version</a> of the page to code.


### Instructions:

Recreate (almost) identically a webpage of 'the Surfing Project', a fake peer-learning surfing school.
